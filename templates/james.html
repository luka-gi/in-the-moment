<h3>James, a police officer</h3>
<p> 
James, 26, is a veteran and police officer in Abbeville, a small city nestled along the Vermilion Bayou of south Louisiana. He has been an officer for four years and is an active member of the community outside of work. Born in nearby Lafayette, James has never felt the desire to leave his home. His mother and father work as traditional south Louisianan shipwrights. James’ passion for his community stems from the strong cultural connection to the area his parents instilled. After graduating from the local public high school, James joined the US Army and served for three consecutive tours. Upon returning home, James joined the local police force.

<p>
James’ experience abroad put the life he enjoyed back home in perspective. He returned, pledging to safeguard his home. James knew that he could interact with the community through various technology platforms, something he may know more about than his older superiors. Determined to make a lasting impact outside of his career as well, James has created a neighborhood watch. Due to its success, James plans to expand this system to other neighborhoods. This is why James believes the In The Moment app is crucial to engaging and strengthening his community.

                <p>James is a police officer in Abbeville, conducting security and emergency response at a local parade. Mardi Gras can be a chaotic time and parades even more so. He has chosen to propose a new method of responding to various needs on the parade grounds. James feels that an application with an interface similar to apps that the majority of his older coworkers use would be easy for them to use efficiently.</p>

                <p>To get the ball rolling, fellow police officers are asked to fill out a survey regarding their phone usage. James collected info on applications used, the frequency used, type of phone, and the total number of applications used per officer. The purpose was to determine the technological proficiency of an older demographic. The results showed that the officers were using applications that were much more complex than In The Moment. Also, even amongst the older officers, google/apple maps were ubiquitously used. James knew he had a match.
                </p>

                <p>James hosts a presentation for the application’s use at the local parade. It is a resounding success, with members able to figure out the features before James covered them. The use of the application at the parade enabled fewer officers to space themselves evenly along the parade route. Additionally, these officers no longer require the expensive vehicular equipment needed for these environments. Officers were able to instantly respond to pin drops at locations where officers needed assistance, on foot. The location pins were shared throughout the entire force present, and a supervisor directed his officers over the radio.Jack sends an email to a primary school teachers’ group to see if anyone can recommend an appropriate system. Two teachers reply and both suggest that he use KidsTakePics, a photo-sharing site that allows teachers to check and moderate content. As KidsTakePicsis not integrated with the iLearn authentication service, he sets up a teacher and a class account with KidsTakePics.</p>

                <p>James has created a neighborhood watch. He is attempting to upgrade the response time and location accuracy of issues in the area. His idea is to use the In The Moment application, but he knows that there are many older members living in his neighborhood. Two of the houses are occupied by older couples, neither of which use any form of computers or smartphones. James plans on having more technologically inclined neighbors help the elderly ones with communicating problems and receiving information.</p>

                <p>James creates a group of all members of the neighborhood willing to sign up on the app. With this new tool, suspicious and illegal activities are able to be reported instantly to the group, with extremely high location accuracy. The mission of the neighborhood watch is to observe and report, not intervene. The system created with the application allows members to respond to disturbances and alert the authority to exact locations.</p>

                <p>James plans to spread this plan to other neighborhoods. His dream is to create an interconnected web of neighborhood watches that would be able to share their pins between themselves. This type of early warning system, James hopes, would eventually be incorporated by his local police force. It is his vision that one day the community will interact seamlessly with emergency responders, and he knows In The Moment is the way to accomplish that.</p>

                <p>As a member of the community I serve, I want to save the most tax dollars possible. I need to employ a system that requires fewer officers on the ground at events.</p>

                <p>While on the neighborhood watch, I need to be able to communicate dangers quickly and accurately to my fellow members.</p>
